			<h3>THE BALLAD OF READING GAOL</h3>

				<span>He did not wear his scarlet coat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For blood and wine are red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blood and wine were on his hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>When they found him with the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The poor dead woman whom he loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And murdered in her bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He walked amongst the Trial Men</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In a suit of shabby grey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cricket cap was on his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And his step seemed light and gay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I never saw a man who looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>So wistfully at the day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I never saw a man who looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With such a wistful eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon that little tent of blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Which prisoners call the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at every drifting cloud that went</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With sails of silver by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I walked, with other souls in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Within another ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And was wondering if the man had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>A great or little thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a voice behind me whispered low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>‘<i>That fellow’s got to swing</i>.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dear Christ! the very prison walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Suddenly seemed to reel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sky above my head became</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Like a casque of scorching steel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, though I was a soul in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>My pain I could not feel.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I only knew what hunted thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Quickened his step, and why</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked upon the garish day</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With such a wistful eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man had killed the thing he loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And so he had to die.</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet each man kills the thing he loves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>By each let this be heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some do it with a bitter look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some with a flattering word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coward does it with a kiss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The brave man with a sword!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some kill their love when they are young,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And some when they are old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some strangle with the hands of Lust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some with the hands of Gold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kindest use a knife, because</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The dead so soon grow cold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some love too little, some too long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some sell, and others buy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some do the deed with many tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And some without a sigh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For each man kills the thing he loves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Yet each man does not die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He does not die a death of shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>On a day of dark disgrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor have a noose about his neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Nor a cloth upon his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor drop feet foremost through the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Into an empty space.</span>

				<span>He does not sit with silent men</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Who watch him night and day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who watch him when he tries to weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And when he tries to pray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who watch him lest himself should rob</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The prison of its prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He does not wake at dawn to see</span>

				<span>He does not rise in piteous haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To put on convict-clothes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Each new and nerve-twitched pose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fingering a watch whose little ticks</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Are like horrible hammer-blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He does not know that sickening thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That sands one’s throat, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hangman with his gardener’s gloves</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Slips through the padded door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And binds one with three leathern thongs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That the throat may thirst no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He does not bend his head to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The Burial Office read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor, while the terror of his soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Tells him he is not dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cross his own coffin, as he moves</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Into the hideous shed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He does not stare upon the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Through a little roof of glass:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He does not pray with lips of clay</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For his agony to pass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The kiss of Caiaphas.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In the suit of shabby grey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His cricket cap was on his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And his step seemed light and gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I never saw a man who looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>So wistfully at the day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I never saw a man who looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With such a wistful eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon that little tent of blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Which prisoners call the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at every wandering cloud that trailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Its ravelled fleeces by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He did not wring his hands, as do</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Those witless men who dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To try to rear the changeling Hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In the cave of black Despair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He only looked upon the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And drank the morning air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He did not wring his hands nor weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Nor did he peek or pine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he drank the air as though it held</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some healthful anodyne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With open mouth he drank the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>As though it had been wine!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I and all the souls in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Who tramped the other ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgot if we ourselves had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>A great or little thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watched with gaze of dull amaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The man who had to swing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And strange it was to see him pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With a step so light and gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strange it was to see him look</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>So wistfully at the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strange it was to think that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Had such a debt to pay.</span>

			<p>
				<span>For oak and elm have pleasant leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That in the springtime shoot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But grim to see is the gallows-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With its adder-bitten root,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, green or dry, a man must die</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Before it bears its fruit!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The loftiest place is that seat of grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For which all worldlings try:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But who would stand in hempen band</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Upon a scaffold high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through a murderer’s collar take</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>His last look at the sky?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is sweet to dance to violins</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>When Love and Life are fair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Is delicate and rare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it is not sweet with nimble feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To dance upon the air!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So with curious eyes and sick surmise</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We watched him day by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wondered if each one of us</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Would end the self-same way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For none can tell to what red Hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>His sightless soul may stray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last the dead man walked no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Amongst the Trial Men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I knew that he was standing up</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In the black dock’s dreadful pen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that never would I see his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In God’s sweet world again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like two doomed ships that pass in storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We had crossed each other’s way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we made no sign, we said no word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We had no word to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we did not meet in the holy night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>But in the shameful day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A prison wall was round us both,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Two outcast men we were:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world had thrust us from its heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And God from out His care:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the iron gin that waits for Sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Had caught us in its snare.</span>
			</p>
			<roman>III</roman>
			<p>
				<span>In Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And the dripping wall is high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So it was there he took the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Beneath the leaden sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by each side a Warder walked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For fear the man might die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or else he sat with those who watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>His anguish night and day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who watched him when he rose to weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And when he crouched to pray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who watched him lest himself should rob</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Their scaffold of its prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Governor was strong upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The Regulations Act:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Doctor said that Death was but</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>A scientific fact:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And twice a day the Chaplain called,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And left a little tract.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And twice a day he smoked his pipe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And drank his quart of beer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His soul was resolute, and held</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>No hiding-place for fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He often said that he was glad</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The hangman’s hands were near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But why he said so strange a thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>No Warder dared to ask:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he to whom a watcher’s doom</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Is given as his task,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must set a lock upon his lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And make his face a mask.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or else he might be moved, and try</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To comfort or console:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what should Human Pity do</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Pent up in Murderers’ Hole?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What word of grace in such a place</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Could help a brother’s soul?</span>

			<p>
				<span>With slouch and swing around the ring</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We trod the Fools’ Parade!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We did not care: we knew we were</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The Devil’s Own Brigade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shaven head and feet of lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Make a merry masquerade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We tore the tarry rope to shreds</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With blunt and bleeding nails;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And cleaned the shining rails:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And clattered with the pails.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We turned the dusty drill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And sweated on the mill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the heart of every man</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Terror was lying still.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So still it lay that every day</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we forgot the bitter lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That waits for fool and knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till once, as we tramped in from work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We passed an open grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With yawning mouth the yellow hole</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Gaped for a living thing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The very mud cried out for blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To the thirsty asphalte ring:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some prisoner had to swing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Right in we went, with soul intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>On Death and Dread and Doom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hangman, with his little bag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Went shuffling through the gloom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each man trembled as he crept</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Into his numbered tomb.</span>

			<p>
				<span>That night the empty corridors</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Were full of forms of Fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up and down the iron town</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Stole feet we could not hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through the bars that hide the stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>White faces seemed to peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He lay as one who lies and dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In a pleasant meadow-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The watchers watched him as he slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And could not understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How one could sleep so sweet a sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With a hangman close at hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But there is no sleep when men must weep</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Who never yet have wept:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That endless vigil kept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through each brain on hands of pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Another’s terror crept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas! it is a fearful thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To feel another’s guilt!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, right within, the sword of Sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Pierced to its poisoned hilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as molten lead were the tears we shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For the blood we had not spilt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Warders with their shoes of felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Crept by each padlocked door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Grey figures on the floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wondered why men knelt to pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Who never prayed before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All through the night we knelt and prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Mad mourners of a corse!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The troubled plumes of midnight were</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The plumes upon a hearse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bitter wine upon a sponge</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Was the savour of Remorse.</span>

			<div class="gapspace"> </div>

				<span>The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,</span>

				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In the corners where we lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each evil sprite that walks by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Before us seemed to play.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They glided past, they glided fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Like travellers through a mist:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They mocked the moon in a rigadoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Of delicate turn and twist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with formal pace and loathsome grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The phantoms kept their tryst.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With mop and mow, we saw them go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Slim shadows hand in hand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About, about, in ghostly rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>They trod a saraband:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the damned grotesques made arabesques,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Like the wind upon the sand!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the pirouettes of marionettes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>They tripped on pointed tread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>As their grisly masque they led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loud they sang, and long they sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For they sang to wake the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘<i>Oho</i>!’ <i>they cried</i>, ‘<i>The world is wide</i>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/><i>But fettered limbs go lame</i>!</span>
				<br/>
				<span><i>And once</i>, <i>or twice</i>, <i>to throw the dice</i></span>

				<span>No things of air these antics were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That frolicked with such glee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To men whose lives were held in gyves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And whose feet might not go free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Most terrible to see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Around, around, they waltzed and wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some wheeled in smirking pairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the mincing step of a demirep</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some sidled up the stairs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Each helped us at our prayers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The morning wind began to moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>But still the night went on:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through its giant loom the web of gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Crept till each thread was spun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as we prayed, we grew afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Of the Justice of the Sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The moaning wind went wandering round</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The weeping prison-wall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till like a wheel of turning steel</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We felt the minutes crawl:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O moaning wind! what had we done</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To have such a seneschal?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last I saw the shadowed bars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Like a lattice wrought in lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move right across the whitewashed wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That faced my three-plank bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I knew that somewhere in the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>God’s dreadful dawn was red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>At seven all was still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the sough and swing of a mighty wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The prison seemed to fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the Lord of Death with icy breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Had entered in to kill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He did not pass in purple pomp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Nor ride a moon-white steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three yards of cord and a sliding board</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Are all the gallows’ need:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So with rope of shame the Herald came</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>To do the secret deed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We were as men who through a fen</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Of filthy darkness grope:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We did not dare to breathe a prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Or to give our anguish scope:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something was dead in each of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And what was dead was Hope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Man’s grim Justice goes its way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And will not swerve aside:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It slays the weak, it slays the strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>It has a deadly stride:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With iron heel it slays the strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The monstrous parricide!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We waited for the stroke of eight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Each tongue was thick with thirst:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That makes a man accursed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Fate will use a running noose</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>For the best man and the worst.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We had no other thing to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Save to wait for the sign to come:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, like things of stone in a valley lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Quiet we sat and dumb:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Like a madman on a drum!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With sudden shock the prison-clock</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Smote on the shivering air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from all the gaol rose up a wail</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Of impotent despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the sound that frightened marshes hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>From some leper in his lair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as one sees most fearful things</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In the crystal of a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We saw the greasy hempen rope</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Hooked to the blackened beam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Strangled into a scream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And all the woe that moved him so</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>That he gave that bitter cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>None knew so well as I:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he who lives more lives than one</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>More deaths than one must die.</span>
			</p>
			<roman>IV</roman>
			<p>
				<span>There is no chapel on the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>On which they hang a man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Chaplain’s heart is far too sick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Or his face is far too wan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or there is that written in his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Which none should look upon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So they kept us close till nigh on noon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And then they rang the bell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Warders with their jingling keys</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Opened each listening cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the iron stair we tramped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Each from his separate Hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Out into God’s sweet air we went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>But not in wonted way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this man’s face was white with fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And that man’s face was grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I never saw sad men who looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>So wistfully at the day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I never saw sad men who looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With such a wistful eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon that little tent of blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>We prisoners called the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at every careless cloud that passed</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In happy freedom by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But there were those amongst us all</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Who walked with downcast head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew that, had each got his due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>They should have died instead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had but killed a thing that lived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Whilst they had killed the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he who sins a second time</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Wakes a dead soul to pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And draws it from its spotted shroud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And makes it bleed again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And makes it bleed in vain!</span>

				<span><indent/>In prison-cell or yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is as that broken box that gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Its treasure to the Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And filled the unclean leper’s house</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>With the scent of costliest nard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! happy they whose hearts can break</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And peace of pardon win!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How else may man make straight his plan</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And cleanse his soul from Sin?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How else but through a broken heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>May Lord Christ enter in?</span>

				<span>And he of the swollen purple throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And the stark and staring eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waits for the holy hands that took</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The Thief to Paradise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a broken and a contrite heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The Lord will not despise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The man in red who reads the Law</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Gave him three weeks of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three little weeks in which to heal</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>His soul of his soul’s strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cleanse from every blot of blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The hand that held the knife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The hand that held the steel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For only blood can wipe out blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And only tears can heal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the crimson stain that was of Cain</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Became Christ’s snow-white seal.</span>

			<p>
				<span>In Reading gaol by Reading town</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>There is a pit of shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in it lies a wretched man</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Eaten by teeth of flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a burning winding-sheet he lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And his grave has got no name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there, till Christ call forth the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>In silence let him lie:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No need to waste the foolish tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Or heave the windy sigh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man had killed the thing he loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>And so he had to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And all men kill the thing they love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>By all let this be heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some do it with a bitter look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>Some with a flattering word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coward does it with a kiss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><indent/>The brave man with a sword!</span>
